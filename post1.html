                    <p class="font-sans py-4">Astrophotography has played a significant role in astronomical discoveries and observations. The use of photography in astronomy dates back to the 19th century. Since then, advancements in technology have allowed for the capture of increasingly detailed and accurate images of celestial objects. Astrophotography has been used to discover and study many different types of objects, including stars, galaxies, nebulae, and planets. Some notable discoveries and observations made using astrophotography include the first photographs of a solar eclipse, the detection of the first known binary star, and the discovery of the first exoplanet. Astrophotography has been used to create detailed maps of the night sky and to study the movements of celestial objects.</p>
                    <p class="font-medium py-1 text-lg">Earlier attempts at Astrophotography</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">John William Draper, New York University Professor of Chemistry, physician and scientific experimenter managed to get the first photograph of the moon, taking a 20-minute-long image from a 5-inch telescope.</p>

                    <p class="font-medium py-1 text-lg">Commercialization of Astrophotography</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">The commercialization of astrophotography has made it more accessible and affordable for amateur astronomers to explore it as a hobby. There are now a wide range of telescopes, cameras available for purchase. There are also many other equipment that are specifically designed for astrophotography. These products have become more advanced and user-friendly over time.</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">One of the main reasons for the increase in popularity of astrophotography as a hobby is the advances in digital technology, which have made it much easier for amateur astronomers to capture and process images. Digital cameras and software have made it possible for amateurs to take high-quality images without the need for expensive film or complex developing processes.</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">Additionally, the internet has also played a big role in the commercialization of astrophotography, as it allows amateurs to share their images and learn from other enthusiasts. There are many online forums and communities dedicated to astrophotography where amateurs can ask questions, share tips and techniques, and get feedback on their work. Social media platforms like Instagram and Flickr also provide a platform for amateur astronomers to showcase their images to a wider audience.</p>
                    <p class="font-medium py-1 text-lg">Astrophotography getting more accessible by increase in computing power</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">The increase in computing power has greatly helped astrophotography by allowing for more advanced image processing techniques. Astrophotography involves capturing multiple images of the same object and combining them to create a final image. This process, known as image stacking requires significant processing power to complete quickly and efficiently.</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">With the increase in computing power, image stacking can now be done much faster, allowing for the creation of higher-quality images. Additionally, more advanced algorithms and software can be used to improve the final image even further. For example, noise reduction algorithms can be used to remove noise and improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the image. Star alignment and stacking software can also be used to automatically align and stack multiple images of the same object.</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">Computing power also allows for the use of more advanced cameras, such as CCD and CMOS, which can capture more detailed images and more data than traditional film cameras. And it also enables the use of more advanced data analysis, such as machine learning algorithms, to classify images and extract more information from them.</p>

                        <span>Many astrophotography projects are now open to the public and allow citizens to contribute their observations to scientific research. This allows researchers to access a larger dataset and make more accurate and precise measurements.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-1 pb-4">
                        <span class="font-medium">Collaborating with professional astronomers:</span>
                        <span>Astrophotographers can also collaborate with professional astronomers to help them in their research. This can include providing them with data and images to support their research and participating in observations at professional observatories.</span>
                    </li>
                    <p class="font-medium py-1 text-lg">Global Meteor Network – Meteor observation: Niche within the Astrophotography</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">The Global Meteor Network (GMN) is an international network of cameras that are used to observe and record meteor showers. The network is made up of volunteer-run cameras that are located in various locations around the world. The cameras are designed to capture images of meteor trails in the night sky. The data collected by the cameras is used to study the characteristics and behavior of meteor showers.</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">It allows for the detection of faint meteor trails that may not be visible to the naked eye or to individual cameras. By combining the data from multiple cameras, the GMN can create a detailed map. It provides information on the shower’s direction, speed, and brightness.</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">The GMN also plays an important role in the discovery of new meteor showers. It monitors the night sky continuously and can detect new meteor showers that might have been missed by traditional observing methods. The network also allows for the study of meteoroids and their origins. By monitoring the meteor shower direction, it can tell us the direction from where the meteoroids were coming, which can help us understand the origin of these meteoroids.</p>
                    <p class="font-medium py-1 text-lg">Conclusion</p>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-4">Recently, the discovery of M31 OIII emission arc (the featured image) was made by an international team of amateur astronomers and scientists. This discovery has shown the astrophotography community how astrophotographers can contribute to astronomy. Overall, astrophotography has been and continues to be a valuable tool. And astrophotography from time to time helps in new astronomical discoveries and furthering our understanding of the universe.</p>
